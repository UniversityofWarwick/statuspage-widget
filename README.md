A StatusPage widget that supports restricting by component. If you don't need to restrict by component
then you may wish to just use [@statuspage/status-widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statuspage/status-widget).

You'll need to pass a `FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable when running `npm i`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. This is what Netlify runs when it deploys the assets.
